## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.

Room for improvement:
- Improvement to be done 1
- Improvement to be done 2

To do:
- Connect to a meals database that has nutrition information
- Ask the user for its macronutrient goals
- Ask the user for how many meals does the user wants to distribute its macronutrients (by default 4)
- Implement the algorithm for creating random meals that meet the macronutrients criteria
- Maybe do a UI?
